A cap table service is an online service that manages records of shareholdings in a company. Usually, these services may provide value adding features, like investor communications, digital agreement signing and share transfer services.  

In this post, we take a look couple of well-known services and if they can be used for an international company. In this case, an international company means a company outside the US, having its shares nominated in some other currency that is not United States Dollar (USD). I did a quick onboarding test and also tweeted for the service providers for additional help.

My criteria for a good cap table management service

* Offers self sign up, so that you can start using a service without a compulsary call with sales rep
* Transparent, upfront, pricing
* Knows about world currencies
